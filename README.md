NOTE: This project is in an experimental stage as I am stil learning how ASM works

# Big Fix
This is a mod that aims to fix and improve upon a bunch of vanilla, forge, and misc stuff from mods that 
are not supported anymore through the use of ASM and mixins. Most if not all fixes aim to address crashes, 
incompatibilities, and performance issues.

### Some fixes
- A Forge crash that happens when too many dimension IDs are registered
